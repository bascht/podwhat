# Pod..what?! Podcast!

Podcasting is a way to distribute audio files<sup>1</sup> through the internet. With the right app you
can listen to your favourite audio book, audio drama, interview or radio show whenever you want.
On demand. On your way to work, in the subway, in your car or at home while cleaning your apartment.

And the best thing about it: most apps download the files and let you listen to them even
when you don't have a good internet connection on your phone. For example in the subway.

<small>1) Also video files and other content, but let's focus on the audio part.</small>

# What type of content is available?

Everything. From award winning radio shows like [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/)
to comedy podcasts like [WTF with Marc Maron](http://www.wtfpod.com/). Or even science fiction
audio plays from the 50s.

# How do I find good podcasts to listen to?

Most podcasting apps have a list of most favourite Podcasts. Scroll through it and pick a few.
Or you can search for your favourite radio shows. Or ask your friends. If you would ask me, I would
highly recommend [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org).

# How does it work?

The first thing would be to install a podcast client (a Podcatcher). There are several options out there, for
example [AntennaPod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod) for Android,
[Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857) for iOS. More apps
can be found [in this list](/clients).

After you installed it, you need to add Podcasts. There are two ways to do ti:

* With the search feature within the app. This is the most comfortable way.
* Add a Podcast manually. Go to the page of the podcast, search for the "Feed URL",
copy that URL and add it in your app. That URL is used by your app to download the episodes.

Now the client will download the episode list and you can usually select the episodes you want
to download. After the downlaod you can start listening to them whenever you want.

And now: happy listening!
